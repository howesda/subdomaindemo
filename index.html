    <a href="http://tk.x155.co.uk" target="_blank">Log in to chatty toolkit</a>
    <p>In this example, our web site is hosted at "x155.co.uk", and the toolkit is at "tk.x155.co.uk"</p>
    <p>In the real world your web site is hosted at "www.chattytoolbox.com", and the toolbox could be at "toolbox.chattytoolbox.com"</p>
